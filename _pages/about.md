I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at University of Michigan, co-advised by [Dr. Honglak Lee](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/) and [Dr. Todd Hollon](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/neurosurgery/todd-hollon-md). Previously I received a B.S. in Computer Science and a M.S. in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Paul Liang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pliang/) and [Dr. Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/).

My research interests are in making machine learning more applicable to the real world, including multimodal machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing. Specifically, I am interested in improving model performance, few-shot generalizations, and model interpretability. 

Previously I have spent three summers doing research, supported by CMU [Summer Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/sura/) (2018), [Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/summer%20research%20fellowships/SURF/) (2020), and Research Intern at [CMU MultiComp Lab](http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/) (2021), and have worked as an undergraduate/graduate research assistant at [CMU SquaresLab](https://squareslab.github.io/) and [CMU MultiComp Lab](http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/). I have also been a software engineer intern at Pinterest in the summer of 2019, and a teaching assistant for CMU 15-210 for 4 semesters.

I have received Honorable Mention in [CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award](https://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/) 2021, and I ranked 107th in [William Lowell Putnam Competition](https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/putnam-competition) in 2017.
